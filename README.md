# [“Pull to refresh” and “Lazy loading” in Swift]

We were finding a pull to refresh demo for one of project in swift for tableview.
We found so many demos working with objective-c but didn't get with swift. 
So We developed this simple demo for "Pull to refresh" and "Lazy loading".
This demo is developed in Xcode 6.1.

# Features

- Supports refresing of data on tableview 
- Supports lazy loading of data on tableview 
- Supports size classes and auto layout
